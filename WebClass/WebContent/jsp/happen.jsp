			<h3>What else should I say?</h3>
			One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found
			himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his
			armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his
			brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff
			sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to
			slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the
			size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's
			happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper
			human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its
			four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out
			on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there
			hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated
			magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted
			out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur
			muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.
			Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops
			of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite
			sad. "How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this
			nonsense", he thought, but that was something he was unable to do
			because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present
			state couldn't get into that position. However hard he threw himself
			onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have
			tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn't have to
			look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel
			a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before. "Oh, God", he
			thought, "what a strenuous career it is that I've chosen! Travelling
			day in and day out. Doing business like this takes much more effort
			than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there's the
			curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad and
			irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that
			you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can
			all go to Hell!" He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed
			himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could
			lift his head better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was
			covered with lots of little white spots which he didn't know what to
			make of; and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he
			drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome
			by a cold shudder. He slid back into his former position. "Getting up
			early all the time", he thought, "it makes you stupid.
