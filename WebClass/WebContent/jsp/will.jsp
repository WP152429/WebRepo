							<p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams,
								he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.
								He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a
								little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided
								by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to
								cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many
								legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him,
								waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he
								thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room
								although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four
								familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out
								on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it
								there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an
								illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It
								showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat
								upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her
								lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the
								window at the dull weather. Drops of rain could be heard hitting
								the pane, which made him feel quite sad. "How about if I sleep a
								little bit longer and forget all this nonsense", he thought, but
								that was something he was unable to do because he was used to
								sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn't get
								into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his
								right, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried
								it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn't have to
								look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to
								feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before. "Oh,
								God", he thought, "what a strenuous career it is that I've
								chosen! Travelling day in and day out. Doing business like this
								takes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and
								on top of that there's the curse of travelling, worries about
								making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with
								different people all the time so that you can never get to know
								anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go to Hell!" He
								felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on
								his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head
								better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered
								with lots of little white spots which he didn't know what to
								make of; and when he tried to feel the place with one of his
								legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he
								was overcome by a cold shudder. He slid back into his former
								position. "Getting up early all the time", he thought, "it makes
								you stupid.</p>
